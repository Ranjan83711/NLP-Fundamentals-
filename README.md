The NLP Roadmap for Machine Learning                                                                
																
The provided text outlines a comprehensive roadmap for learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) for machine learning and deep learning. The core idea is to enable a machine to understand human language by converting text into a numerical format, specifically "meaningful vectors".
Here is a detailed summary of the important points:
1. The Problem with Text Data
	• Machine learning models typically work with numerical data (e.g., continuous or categorical features).
	• Human language (text) is unstructured and not directly understandable by these models.
	• The solution is NLP: A domain that provides techniques to process text data and convert it into a numerical representation (vectors) that a model can interpret.
2. The NLP Roadmap (Pyramid Structure from Bottom to Top)
The roadmap is structured in a progressive manner, starting with fundamental concepts and moving towards more advanced techniques. As you move up the pyramid, the models become more accurate but also more complex and computationally intensive.
	• Foundation: Python Programming Language. A strong understanding of Python is essential for implementing NLP tasks and using relevant libraries.
	• Step 1: Text Pre-processing (Part 1)
		○ Goal: Clean the raw text data.
		○ Techniques:
			§ Tokenization: Breaking down text into smaller units (words, sentences, etc.).
			§ Lemmatization: Reducing words to their meaningful base or root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
			§ Stemming: Reducing words to their root form by stripping suffixes (e.g., "programmer" becomes "program").
			§ Stopwords: Removing common words that have little to no semantic value (e.g., "the", "is", "a").
	• Step 2: Text Pre-processing (Part 2 - Converting Text to Vectors)
		○ Goal: Convert the cleaned text into numerical vectors that a machine can understand.
		○ Techniques:
			§ Bag-of-Words (BoW): Represents a document by the count of each word, disregarding grammar and word order.
			§ TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A statistical measure that evaluates how important a word is to a document in a corpus. It gives more weight to rare words and less to common words.
			§ Unigrams and Bigrams: Concepts of sequential words (e.g., "natural language" is a bigram).
	• Step 3: Text Pre-processing (Part 3 - Advanced Vectorization)
		○ Goal: Create more meaningful and contextually aware word vectors.
		○ Techniques:
			§ Word2Vec: A neural network-based technique that learns word associations from a large corpus of text. It creates dense vectors where semantically similar words are located closer to each other in the vector space.
			§ Average Word2Vec: An extension of Word2Vec where the vector for a sentence or document is the average of the vectors of its constituent words.
3. Transition to Deep Learning
	• RNN, LSTM, and GRU: These are types of neural networks specifically designed to handle sequential data, like text. They are used for tasks like spam classification and text summarization.
		○ RNN (Recurrent Neural Network): A basic network for sequential data.
		○ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): More advanced versions of RNNs that address the "vanishing gradient problem" and are better at capturing long-term dependencies in a sequence.
	• Word Embeddings: An amazing way to convert input text into vectors. These techniques are often built on top of Word2Vec, allowing the model to learn its own representations of words.
	• Advanced Techniques (State-of-the-Art):
		○ Transformers and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): These are the most advanced techniques. They are more powerful and achieve higher accuracy, but also have larger model sizes and require more computational resources.
4. Libraries for NLP
	• For Machine Learning:
		○ NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A foundational library for educational and research purposes.
		○ spaCy: A modern, production-ready library known for its speed and efficiency.
	• For Deep Learning:
		○ TensorFlow: An open-source library developed by Google.
		○ PyTorch: An open-source library developed by Facebook.

Core Concepts of Natural Language Processing
This video provides a foundational overview of key terminologies in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The main focus is on tokenization, a fundamental step in text preprocessing, and other related concepts like corpus, documents, and vocabulary. The goal is to lay the groundwork for understanding how computers process human language by breaking it down into manageable units.

1. Fundamental Terminology
	• Corpus: A collection of text, typically in the form of a paragraph. It is the complete body of text you are working with.
	• Documents: Individual sentences within a corpus. A corpus is made up of multiple documents.
	• Vocabulary (or Unique Words): The set of all unique words present in the entire corpus. It is the dictionary of all possible words. The size of the vocabulary is the total count of these unique words.
	• Words: The individual words that make up the corpus.

2. What is Tokenization?
Tokenization is a crucial preprocessing step in NLP. It is the process of breaking down a large piece of text into smaller, meaningful units called tokens. The tokens can be words, sentences, or even characters, depending on the specific task.
	• Paragraph to Sentence Tokenization: This process involves taking a corpus (paragraph) and splitting it into individual sentences (documents). The split is typically done based on punctuation marks like periods (.), question marks (?), or exclamation points (!).
	• Sentence to Word Tokenization: This process takes a sentence and breaks it down into individual words. Each word then becomes a token.
Example:
If the corpus is: "I like to drink apple juice. My friend likes mango juice."
	• Paragraph-to-Sentence Tokenization would produce two tokens:
		1. "I like to drink apple juice."
		2. "My friend likes mango juice."
	• Sentence-to-Word Tokenization on the first sentence would produce the following tokens:
		○ "I"
		○ "like"
		○ "to"
		○ "drink"
		○ "apple"
		○ "juice"

3. Why is Tokenization Important?
	• Foundation for Vectorization: Tokenization is a necessary step because each individual word in the text needs to be converted into a numerical vector for a machine learning model to process it. By breaking down the text into words, we can then apply various techniques to create these vectors.
	• Text Preprocessing: It is a core part of the text preprocessing pipeline. Without this step, it would be impossible to perform subsequent cleaning and feature engineering tasks, such as removing stopwords or performing stemming and lemmatization.
The next video will demonstrate how to perform tokenization in Python using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library.



============================================================================================================


1. Introduction to Text Pre-processing and Stemming
This is a continuation of a series on NLP, focusing on advanced text pre-processing techniques. Following the previous topic tokenization (converting paragraphs to sentences and words), this video introduces stemming, a crucial process for reducing words to their root form.
2. What is Stemming?
	• Definition: Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its "word stem," which is the root or base form of the word. This is done by removing affixes (prefixes, suffixes, or infixes).
	• Purpose: Stemming is essential for NLP because it helps in standardizing words that have the same meaning but different forms (e.g., "eating," "eats," "eaten" all relate to the root word "eat").
	• Benefits:
		○ Reduces Feature Space: By converting multiple forms of a word (e.g., "eating," "eats") into a single stem ("eat"), stemming reduces the total number of unique words in a dataset. This is beneficial because each unique word is typically treated as a feature in machine learning models.
		○ Improves Model Efficiency: A smaller, more consistent vocabulary leads to a more efficient and potentially more accurate model, especially in tasks like sentiment analysis or classification.
3. Stemming Techniques with NLTK
The video demonstrates three common stemming techniques available in the NLTK library.
a) Porter Stemmer
	• Description: This is one of the most well-known and widely used stemming algorithms. It's an older technique but still very relevant.
	• Implementation:
		1. Import PorterStemmer from nltk.stem.
		2. Create an instance of the class: stemming = PorterStemmer().
		3. Use the stem() function to get the root of a word: stemming.stem(word).
	• Examples:
		○ eating -> eat
		○ eats -> eat
		○ writing -> write
		○ programming -> program
	• Major Disadvantage: The Porter Stemmer can sometimes be too aggressive, resulting in a stem that is not a real or meaningful word.
		○ Example 1: history -> histori (meaningless)
		○ Example 2: congratulations -> congratul (meaningless)
		○ This loss of grammatical accuracy is a significant drawback.
b) Regular Expression (Regex) Stemmer
	• Description: This is a more flexible stemming technique that uses regular expressions to define the affixes to be removed.
	• Implementation:
		1. Import RegexpStemmer from nltk.stem.
		2. Initialize it with a regular expression pattern that specifies the suffixes to remove. The pattern uses the | symbol for "OR" and the $ symbol to match the end of a string.
			§ reg_stem = RegexpStemmer('ing$|s$|e$|able$')
	• Example:
		○ eating -> eat (because ing at the end is matched and removed)
		○ eats -> eat (because s at the end is matched and removed)
	• Flexibility: This method allows the user to define exactly which suffixes to remove, providing more control than a predefined algorithm like the Porter Stemmer.
c) Snowball Stemmer
	• Description: Also known as the "Porter2" stemmer, this algorithm is an improvement upon the original Porter Stemmer. It is generally considered more accurate and performs better.
	• Implementation:
		1. Import SnowballStemmer from nltk.stem.
		2. Initialize it, specifying the language (e.g., English).
			§ snowball_stemmer = SnowballStemmer("English")
		3. Use the stem() function on a word.
	• Advantages over Porter Stemmer: The Snowball Stemmer handles more exceptions and provides more accurate stems for certain words.
		○ Example:
			§ Porter Stemmer: fairly -> fairli, sportingly -> sportingli
			§ Snowball Stemmer: fairly -> fair, sportingly -> sport
	• Disadvantage: Despite being an improvement, the Snowball Stemmer can still produce meaningless stems for some words (e.g., history still becomes histori), similar to the Porter Stemmer.
4. Stemming vs. Lemmatization
	• Stemming's Core Problem: The main disadvantage of stemming is that it is a heuristic process. It blindly removes suffixes without considering the word's context or whether the resulting stem is a real word. This can lead to grammatically incorrect or meaningless results.
	• Solution: Lemmatization: The video briefly introduces lemmatization as a more advanced and accurate alternative.
		○ Lemmatization uses a dictionary or a lexical knowledge base to find the lemma (the canonical, dictionary form) of a word.
		○ It guarantees that the resulting word is a grammatically correct and meaningful word.
		○ Examples: goes -> go, fairly -> fair, eating -> eat.
	• When to use each:
		○ Stemming is often sufficient for simple classification problems (e.g., spam detection) where speed is more important than grammatical accuracy.
		○ Lemmatization is preferred for more complex applications like chatbots, question-answering systems, or any task where the meaning and grammatical correctness of words are critical.

===============================================================================================


Lemmatization and Stemming

1. The Problem with Stemming
Previous we covered stemming, a process that reduces a word to its "word stem" by chopping off suffixes. While useful for reducing the number of unique words, stemming's main disadvantage is that it's a rule-based algorithm that doesn't always produce a valid, meaningful word. For example, history becomes histori, and congratulations becomes congratul. The resulting words are often not found in a standard dictionary and lose their original meaning.

2. What is Lemmatization?
Lemmatization is a process similar to stemming but with a key difference: it reduces a word to its "lemma," which is the root word or the dictionary form of the word. Unlike stemming, lemmatization guarantees that the output is a grammatically valid and meaningful word. This is because it uses a lexical knowledge base, or a dictionary, to find the correct root form.
	• Key Feature: The process relies on the WordNet corpus, which acts as a dictionary, allowing the algorithm to find the correct root word. This is why it's more accurate but also more computationally intensive than stemming.

3. Implementing Lemmatization with NLTK
The video demonstrates how to use the WordNetLemmatizer class from the NLTK library.
	• Import and Initialization:
Python

from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
	• The lemmatize() Function and Part-of-Speech (POS) Tags:
		○ The lemmatize() function takes a word and an optional Part-of-Speech (POS) tag.
		○ The POS tag is crucial because a word can have different lemmas depending on whether it's used as a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb.
		○ Default Behavior: If no POS tag is provided, the function defaults to treating the word as a noun ('n').
		○ POS Tags:
			§ n: Noun (default)
			§ v: Verb
			§ a: Adjective
			§ r: Adverb
	• Demonstration:
		○ When lemmatizing going with the default POS tag (n), the output is going. This is because the algorithm treats going as a noun and finds no change.
		○ However, when the POS tag is specified as a verb (v), the correct lemma is found: lemmatizer.lemmatize('going', pos='v') returns go.
		○ When applied to a list of words, using the correct POS tag ('v') yields accurate results:
			§ eating -> eat
			§ writing -> write
			§ goes -> go
		○ A key advantage shown is that history remains history (the correct word) with lemmatization, unlike stemming where it was reduced to histori. Similarly, words like fairly and sportingly correctly lemmatize to fair and sport.

4. Lemmatization vs. Stemming: A Comparison

Feature	Stemming	Lemmatization
Output	Word Stem (may not be a valid word)	Lemma (a valid, dictionary word)
Method	Rule-based algorithm (removes suffixes)	Dictionary-based (uses WordNet corpus)
Accuracy	Lower; can produce meaningless words	Higher; maintains grammatical meaning
Speed	Faster; simple algorithm	Slower; requires looking up words in a dictionary
Best For	Use cases where speed is critical and grammatical accuracy is less important (e.g., spam detection)	Use cases that require high accuracy and grammatical correctness (e.g., chatbots, text summarization, Q&A systems)

=================================================================================================


In natural language processing, stopwords are common words that often don't add significant meaning to a text and can be filtered out during pre-processing. Removing them helps improve the efficiency and performance of NLP models.

What are Stopwords?
Stopwords are a list of high-frequency words such as "the," "a," "is," "and," "I," "he," "she," and "it." These words are used so frequently in a language that they are often considered to have little to no semantic value for certain NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, or information retrieval.
	• Importance of Removal: The primary reason for removing stopwords is to reduce the size of the vocabulary and the dimensionality of the data. This helps a machine learning model focus on more informative and unique words that carry the most weight in determining a text's context or meaning. For instance, in a sentiment analysis task, words like "good" or "bad" are far more important than "the" or "is."
	• Language-Specific: Stopwords are language-dependent. The list of stopwords for English will be different from those for German, French, or Arabic. The NLTK library provides pre-defined lists of stopwords for many languages.

Implementing a Complete Text Pre-processing Pipeline with NLTK
The video demonstrates a comprehensive text pre-processing pipeline that combines several techniques to clean a given paragraph of text.
Step 1: Get the Stopwords List
First, you need to import the stopwords module from NLTK and download the necessary package if it's not already on your system.
Python

import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
# Download stopwords (only needs to be done once)
nltk.download('stopwords')
# Get the list of English stopwords
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
Step 2: Tokenize the Text
The input paragraph is first tokenized into individual sentences, and then each sentence is tokenized into a list of words.
Python

from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize
# Tokenize the paragraph into sentences
sentences = sent_tokenize(paragraph)
Step 3: Apply Stopword Removal, Lemmatization, and Case Conversion
The core of the process involves iterating through each word in the text and applying a series of checks and transformations:
	1. Lowercasing: Convert all words to lowercase to ensure consistency and prevent the same word (e.g., "India" and "india") from being treated as different tokens.
	2. Stopword Filtering: Check if the word is present in the stop_words set. If it is not, proceed to the next step. This is the most crucial step for filtering out redundant words.
	3. Lemmatization: For the words that remain, apply lemmatization (using WordNetLemmatizer) to reduce them to their root form. As shown in the previous video, lemmatization is preferred over stemming because it produces grammatically correct words. You can also specify the Part-of-Speech (POS) tag for more accurate results.
Final Output
After applying all these steps, the original paragraph of text is transformed into a clean, concise version containing only the most meaningful words in their base form. This optimized text is then ready to be converted into numerical vectors for training a machine learning model.
The video shows how the raw text, "I have three visions for India...," is transformed into a more manageable and focused output like, "I three vision India...," with all common words and punctuation removed. This significantly reduces the complexity of the data while preserving its core informational content.

=================================================================================================

What is Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging?
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a process that assigns a grammatical category or tag to each word in a text, such as a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. The tag provides information about the word's role and meaning in a sentence. For example, in the sentence "The cat sat on the mat," the word "cat" would be tagged as a noun (NN), and "sat" would be tagged as a verb (VBD). This process is a fundamental step in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including information extraction, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
The video explains that NLTK's POS tagger is a powerful tool for this task. It's essentially an automated system that reads text and assigns a tag to each word. The NLTK library provides a pre-trained tagger that can be used out-of-the-box on English text.
How to use NLTK for POS Tagging
To use NLTK for POS tagging, you need to follow a few simple steps. The process is straightforward, but it's important to understand the input and output formats.
Step 1: Import NLTK and Download the Tagger
First, you need to import the NLTK library and download the averaged_perceptron_tagger model. This model is a pre-trained tagger that NLTK uses to perform POS tagging. If you haven't downloaded it before, you can do so using nltk.download().
Python

import nltk
# Download the 'averaged_perceptron_tagger'
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') 
Step 2: Tokenize the Sentence
Before you can tag the words, you need to break the sentence into individual words. This is a common pre-processing step known as word tokenization. The nltk.word_tokenize() function is used for this purpose.
Python

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
text = "The cat sat on the mat."
words = word_tokenize(text)
# Output: ['The', 'cat', 'sat', 'on', 'the', 'mat', '.']
Step 3: Perform POS Tagging
Once the text is tokenized into a list of words, you can use nltk.pos_tag() to assign a tag to each word. The function takes a list of words as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the word and its corresponding POS tag.
Python

tagged_words = nltk.pos_tag(words)
# Output: [('The', 'DT'), ('cat', 'NN'), ('sat', 'VBD'), ('on', 'IN'), ('the', 'DT'), ('mat', 'NN'), ('.', '.')]
Understanding POS Tags
The tags returned by NLTK are part of the Penn Treebank tagset, which is a standardized set of tags used for annotating text. While it's not necessary to memorize all of them, knowing the most common ones is helpful.
Here are some of the most frequently encountered tags:
	• NN: Noun, singular or mass (e.g., cat, dog, water)
	• NNS: Noun, plural (e.g., cats, dogs, trees)
	• NNP: Proper noun, singular (e.g., India, Google)
	• VB: Verb, base form (e.g., eat, go, run)
	• VBD: Verb, past tense (e.g., ate, went, ran)
	• VBG: Verb, gerund or present participle (e.g., eating, going, running)
	• JJ: Adjective (e.g., big, happy, red)
	• DT: Determiner (e.g., the, a, an)
	• IN: Preposition or subordinating conjunction (e.g., on, in, of)
The Importance of POS Tagging
POS tagging is a crucial step in many NLP pipelines because the same word can have different meanings and roles depending on the context. For example, the word "book" can be a noun ("I read a great book") or a verb ("I want to book a flight"). A POS tagger can differentiate between these two uses and provide the correct tag (NN and VB, respectively).
This helps downstream tasks in NLP by providing crucial grammatical information. For example:
	• Named Entity Recognition (NER): A system can use POS tags to identify proper nouns (NNP) that might be part of a person's name, a location, or an organization.
	• Lemmatization: As discussed in the previous videos, lemmatization (reducing a word to its base form) can be more accurate when a word's POS is known. For example, knowing that "running" is a verb allows a lemmatizer to correctly reduce it to "run," whereas if it's not a verb, it might not be reduced correctly.
In short, POS tagging provides an essential layer of linguistic information that helps machine learning models and NLP applications understand the structure and meaning of text more effectively.

==================================================================================================


One-hot encoding is a method of converting textual data into a numerical format that machine learning models can understand. The process involves representing each word in a document as a unique vector. This technique is one of the foundational methods for vectorizing text.

The Core Idea of One-Hot Encoding
The central concept behind one-hot encoding is to represent each word in a vocabulary as a binary vector. This vector has a length equal to the total number of unique words in the entire corpus (the collection of all documents).
	• Vocabulary: The first step is to create a list of all unique words, or the vocabulary, from the entire text corpus.
	• Vector Creation: For each word, a vector is created. This vector consists of zeros in all positions except for one, where a '1' is placed. The position of the '1' corresponds to the word's unique index in the vocabulary list.
A Step-by-Step Example
Let's use the provided example corpus to illustrate the process:
	• Document 1 (D1): "The food is good"
	• Document 2 (D2): "The food is bad"
	• Document 3 (D3): "Pizza is amazing"
Step 1: Create the Unique Vocabulary
Combine all words from the documents and list the unique ones.
Vocabulary = ['The', 'food', 'is', 'good', 'bad', 'pizza', 'amazing']
The size of this vocabulary is 7. Therefore, each word will be represented by a vector of length 7.
Step 2: Map Each Word to a One-Hot Vector
Each word in the vocabulary is assigned a unique index (from 0 to 6). A '1' will be placed at that index in the vector, and all other positions will be '0'.
	• The: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
	• food: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
	• is: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
	• good: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
	• bad: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
	• pizza: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
	• amazing: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Step 3: Represent Each Document as a Series of Vectors
Now, each document can be represented as a sequence of these one-hot vectors.
	• D1 ("The food is good"):
		○ The vector for "The"
		○ The vector for "food"
		○ The vector for "is"
		○ The vector for "good"
The resulting representation is a matrix with a shape of 4 x 7 (4 words in the document, 7 words in the vocabulary).
	• D2 ("The food is bad"):
		○ The vector for "The"
		○ The vector for "food"
		○ The vector for "is"
		○ The vector for "bad"
This also results in a 4 x 7 matrix. The only difference is the last vector, which corresponds to "bad" instead of "good."
Advantages and Disadvantages (Preview)
one-hot encoding is a simple, intuitive method but has significant drawbacks. The main issue is the high dimensionality of the vectors, especially with large vocabularies. This leads to what is known as the curse of dimensionality, where the large number of features makes the model less efficient and more difficult to train. Additionally, one-hot encoding fails to capture the relationships or semantic similarities between words. Words like "good" and "amazing" are represented as being equally distant from each other as "good" and "pizza," which is not semantically accurate.
These limitations are why more advanced techniques like Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF are often used instead.

==================================================================================================



Bag of Words (BoW) Model
BoW is a simple method to convert text into a numerical format. It represents a document as an unordered collection of words, ignoring grammar and word order. Instead, it only cares about which words are present and how often they appear.

Advantages
	• Simple to Implement: It's an intuitive and easy method to get started with text data.
	• Effective for Classification: It works well for tasks like spam detection or sentiment analysis, where the presence of certain keywords is more important than their order.

Disadvantages
	• Ignores Word Order: It treats sentences like "the food is good" and "good is the food" identically, which can lead to a loss of meaning.
	• Sparsity: For large vocabularies, the resulting data matrix has many zeros, which can be computationally inefficient.
	• No Semantics: It doesn't understand the relationship between words (e.g., it sees "good" and "great" as completely different words).

Implementation using NLTK
The process involves a few key steps:
	1. Text Pre-processing: Clean the text by converting it to lowercase and removing stopwords and punctuation.
	2. Create Vocabulary: Build a list of all unique words from the cleaned corpus.
	3. Generate Vectors: For each document, create a vector where each position corresponds to a word in the vocabulary, and the value is the word's frequency in that document.


================================================================================================


What Are N-Grams?
N-grams are contiguous sequences of n items (words, letters, or phonemes) from a given sample of text or speech. The primary intuition behind n-grams is to capture some of the local context and word order that the Bag of Words model ignores.
	• Unigrams (n=1): Single words. This is the same as the Bag of Words model.
		○ Example: "the", "cat", "sat"
	• Bigrams (n=2): Sequences of two words.
		○ Example: "the cat", "cat sat", "sat on"
	• Trigrams (n=3): Sequences of three words.
		○ Example: "the cat sat", "cat sat on"
N-grams are useful because they can capture common phrases or expressions. This is particularly important for tasks where word order matters, like text generation or sentiment analysis (e.g., "not good" is a bigram that holds more meaning than the individual words "not" and "good").

Implementation Using NLTK
The NLTK library provides simple functions to create n-grams from a text. The process generally involves tokenizing the text first, then generating the n-grams.
	1. Tokenize the Text: First, break the sentence into a list of words.
Python

import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "The food is not good."
tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
# tokens = ['the', 'food', 'is', 'not', 'good', '.']
	2. Generate N-grams: Use the nltk.ngrams() function, which takes the list of tokens and the desired value of n as arguments. The function returns an iterator of tuples, which you can convert into a list.
		○ Bigrams (n=2):
Python

bigrams = list(nltk.ngrams(tokens, 2))
# bigrams = [('the', 'food'), ('food', 'is'), ('is', 'not'), ('not', 'good'), ('good', '.')]
		○ Trigrams (n=3):
Python

trigrams = list(nltk.ngrams(tokens, 3))
# trigrams = [('the', 'food', 'is'), ('food', 'is', 'not'), ('is', 'not', 'good'), ('not', 'good', '.')]
N-grams and Text Vectorization
Like the Bag of Words model, n-grams can be used to create a feature vector for a document. Instead of counting single words, you count the occurrences of n-grams.
	1. Create a Vocabulary: Collect all unique n-grams from your corpus.
	2. Generate a Matrix: Create a document-n-gram matrix where each row represents a document and each column represents a unique n-gram. The values are the frequency counts of each n-gram in the document.
While n-grams capture local context, they also increase the vocabulary size significantly, leading to a much sparser and higher-dimensional feature space. This can make models more complex and computationally expensive.


=================================================================================================


TF-IDF Intuition
TF-IDF, which stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, is a statistical method used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The intuition is simple: a word's importance increases proportionally to its frequency in a document but is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word.
	• Term Frequency (TF): This part measures how often a word appears in a document. The more frequent the word, the higher its TF score. A high TF suggests the word is important within that specific document.
	• Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): This part measures the importance of a word across the entire corpus. Words that appear in many documents (like "the" or "a") get a low IDF score, reducing their overall weight. Words that are rare and specific to only a few documents (like "blockchain" or "quantum") get a high IDF score, increasing their importance.
TF-IDF combines these two scores. The product of TF and IDF gives a final weight for each word, highlighting words that are frequent in a single document but rare across the entire corpus.


=================================================================================================


What Are Word Embeddings?
Word embeddings are a form of text representation where words or phrases are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Unlike one-hot encoding or Bag-of-Words, which create sparse, high-dimensional vectors, word embeddings create dense vectors that capture the semantic and syntactic relationships between words. This means that words with similar meanings, like "king" and "queen," will have similar vector representations and be close to each other in the vector space.
The core idea is that a word's meaning can be inferred from its context—the words that appear around it. By analyzing massive amounts of text, embedding models learn to represent words in a way that reflects their co-occurrence patterns, effectively capturing their meaning.

Key Models for Word Embeddings
Several models have been developed to learn these dense vector representations. The most popular ones include:
	• Word2Vec: This is one of the most famous models for creating word embeddings. It comes in two flavors:
		○ Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW): This model predicts a target word based on its surrounding context words. It's fast and works well with frequent words.
		○ Skip-gram: This model, conversely, uses a target word to predict the context words around it. It's slower but performs better with infrequent words.
	• GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation): Unlike Word2Vec, which is based on local context windows, GloVe is a count-based model. It combines the advantages of both local context (from Word2Vec) and global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus. This helps it learn more meaningful vector representations.
	• FastText: Developed by Facebook, FastText is an extension of Word2Vec. The key difference is that it treats each word as a "bag of character n-grams." This allows it to create good embeddings for words that are not in its vocabulary (out-of-vocabulary or OOV words) and to capture the morphology of words (e.g., "running" and "run" share the same root).

Advantages of Word Embeddings
	• Captures Semantic Relationships: The most significant advantage is that word embeddings capture the meaning of words. For example, in a well-trained embedding space, the vector for "king" minus "man" plus "woman" will be very close to the vector for "queen."
	• Dimensionality Reduction: They represent words in a much lower-dimensional space compared to one-hot encoding, making models more efficient and less prone to the curse of dimensionality.
	• Solves the OOV Problem: Some models like FastText can handle unseen words by analyzing their sub-word components.

What is Word2Vec?
Word2Vec is a deep learning-based technique for Natural Language Processing (NLP) published by Google in 2013. Its primary purpose is to convert words into numerical vectors, also known as word embeddings. The key distinction of Word2Vec is that these vectors are not arbitrary; they are designed to capture the semantic and syntactic relationships between words. This means that words with similar meanings will have vectors that are numerically close to each other in a vector space.
	• Core Idea: The model learns a word's meaning from its context—the words that appear near it in a large corpus of text. By doing this, it can detect synonyms, antonyms, and even complex analogies.

How Word2Vec Creates Word Embeddings
Unlike older methods like Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF, which result in sparse matrices and don't capture word relationships, Word2Vec creates a dense vector representation for each word.
The process can be understood through a concept called feature representation.
	1. Vocabulary: The model first identifies all unique words in a corpus to create a vocabulary.
	2. Feature Dimensions: Instead of a simple count, each word is represented by a vector of a fixed size (e.g., 300 dimensions). While the exact "features" represented by these dimensions are not human-interpretable, they can be thought of as abstract concepts like "gender," "royalty," or "age."
	3. Vector Values: The model assigns a numerical value to each feature dimension for every word. These values are learned through a neural network model.
		○ Example: For a "gender" feature, "boy" might have a value of -1, while "girl" has a value of +1, showing their opposing relationship.
		○ For a "royal" feature, "king" and "queen" might have similar high values (e.g., 0.95), while "boy" or "girl" have values close to zero (e.g., 0.01), indicating no strong relationship.
The final output is a vector for each word in the vocabulary, which is a dense collection of numbers that capture its meaning in relation to other words.

Vector Analogies and Cosine Similarity
A key advantage of Word2Vec is that the relationships between words can be modeled using simple vector arithmetic.
	• Vector Analogies: A famous example is the analogy "King - Man + Woman ≈ Queen." In the vector space, the vector for "King" minus the vector for "Man," plus the vector for "Woman," results in a new vector that is very close to the vector for "Queen." This shows that the model successfully learned the gender and royalty relationships.
	• Cosine Similarity: To measure the similarity between two word vectors, we use cosine similarity. This metric measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
		○ If the vectors are very close to each other, the angle is small (close to 0 degrees), and the cosine similarity is close to 1. This means the words are highly similar.
		○ If the vectors are orthogonal (at 90 degrees), the cosine similarity is 0, indicating no relationship.
		○ If they are in opposite directions, the cosine similarity is -1, indicating they are opposites.
The distance between two vectors is often calculated as 1 - cosine_similarity. A distance close to 0 means the words are very similar, while a distance close to 1 means they are very different.

How Word2Vec is Trained
The video previews that the next session will detail how Word2Vec models are trained using simple neural networks. The key is understanding how the model learns these vector representations from the context of words in a large text corpus without explicit supervision. The two main architectures are:

	• Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW): Predicts the target word from the surrounding context.
	• Skip-gram: Predicts the surrounding context words from a target word.
	
This training process is what allows the model to learn the complex, meaningful relationships that make Word2Vec a powerful tool in NLP.


================================================================================================


Understanding the CBOW Word2Vec Model
The video provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model works as a part of the Word2Vec algorithm. It focuses on the core deep learning architecture and training process that converts words into meaningful vectors.

1. The CBOW Model's Objective
The goal of the CBOW model is to predict a target word from its surrounding context words. This is a supervised learning task.
	• Window Size: A crucial hyperparameter is the window size, which determines how many context words are considered around the target word. The video suggests using an odd number (like 5) so that the target word is perfectly centered, with an equal number of words on its left and right.
	• Input and Output Data:
		○ Input: The context words (e.g., for a window size of 5, you have 2 words to the left and 2 words to the right).
		○ Output: The center or target word.
For example, with the sentence "I neuron company is related to data science" and a window size of 5:
	• Input: [I, neuron, company, related, to]
	• Output: [is]

2. The Neural Network Architecture
The CBOW model is a simple, fully connected neural network with three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.
	• Input Layer:
		○ Each unique word in the vocabulary is first converted into a one-hot encoded vector.
		○ The input layer takes the one-hot vectors of all the context words (e.g., 4 words with a window size of 5).
		○ The size of each input node is the size of the vocabulary (V).
	• Hidden Layer:
		○ This is the most critical layer. Its size (let's call it N) determines the dimensionality of the final word vectors.
		○ The size of this hidden layer is directly set by the user (e.g., 5 or 300). This is the "feature representation" of each word.
		○ All the input one-hot vectors are averaged and then fed into this hidden layer.
		○ The hidden layer's output is the word embedding itself.
	• Output Layer:
		○ The output layer predicts the probability distribution of the target word. It has a size equal to the vocabulary size (V).
		○ It uses a softmax activation function to convert the scores into probabilities that sum to 1. The goal is for the probability of the actual target word to be as close to 1 as possible.

3. The Training Process
The model is trained using a process similar to a standard supervised neural network:
	1. Forward Propagation: Input context words (as one-hot vectors) are fed into the network. They pass through the hidden layer, and the output layer produces a probability distribution.
	2. Loss Calculation: The model's predicted output (the probability distribution, or yhat​) is compared to the actual target word's one-hot encoded vector (y). A loss function, such as cross-entropy loss, measures the difference.
	3. Backward Propagation: The loss is backpropagated through the network to update the weights and biases. The goal is to minimize the loss, which means the model is getting better at predicting the target word from its context.
	4. Final Word Vectors: The beauty of the Word2Vec model is that the final word vectors are the weights of the hidden layer. Once the model is trained and the loss is minimal, the learned weights from the input layer to the hidden layer become the dense vector representations for each word. The size of these vectors is the same as the hidden layer's dimension.
This process ensures that words that appear in similar contexts will have similar vector representations. For example, if "cat" and "dog" are often seen in the same contexts, their vectors will be very close. The same principle applies to words with different but related meanings, like "King" and "Queen."


==================================================================================================


The Skip-gram model is the second architecture of Word2Vec.1 While it shares the same goal as the CBOW model—to learn word embeddings—it reverses the task. Instead of predicting the center word from its context, Skip-gram predicts the surrounding context words from a given center word.2

Key Differences from CBOW
The main difference between Skip-gram and CBOW lies in their input and output structure.
	• CBOW:
		○ Input: Multiple context words.
		○ Output: A single target word.
	• Skip-gram:
		○ Input: A single target word.
		○ Output: Multiple context words.
For example, using the sentence "I neuron company is related to data science" and a window size of 5:
	• The input for the Skip-gram model would be the center word, "is."3
	• The output would be the context words: "I," "neuron," "company," "related," and "to."
This creates multiple training pairs for each target word, making the model more robust.4 For instance, the training pairs for the target word "is" would be (is, I), (is, neuron), (is, company), (is, related), and (is, to).

Neural Network Architecture
The Skip-gram neural network architecture is also a simple fully connected neural network, but with a different structure to reflect its objective.
	• Input Layer: A single node with a size equal to the vocabulary size (V), representing the one-hot encoded vector of the target word.5
	• Hidden Layer: This is the projection layer, whose size (N) determines the dimensionality of the final word vectors. It's the same as in CBOW.6
	• Output Layer: This layer has multiple nodes, one for each context word. The size of the output layer is equal to the number of context words. Each node has a size equal to the vocabulary size (V).
The training process is similar to CBOW: the model uses forward and backward propagation to minimize the difference between predicted probabilities and the actual context words.7 Once training is complete, the weights of the hidden layer become the final word embeddings.8

When to Use CBOW vs. Skip-gram
The choice between the two models depends on the dataset and the specific use case:
	• CBOW (Continuous Bag-of-Words):
		○ Generally faster to train.
		○ Works better with small corpora.
		○ Good for frequent words.
	• Skip-gram:
		○ Slower to train.
		○ Works better with large corpora.
		○ Performs well with infrequent words and can handle a larger vocabulary.
The Skip-gram model is often the preferred choice for large-scale applications like Google's pre-trained Word2Vec model, which was trained on 3 billion words and produces 300-dimensional vectors. This large window size and vocabulary allow for more nuanced and accurate embeddings.
To improve the performance of either model, you can:
	• Increase the size of your training data. More data leads to better accuracy.
	• Increase the window size. A larger window size leads to higher-dimensional vectors and can capture more contextual information.
