The NLP Roadmap for Machine Learning
The provided text outlines a comprehensive roadmap for learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) for machine learning and deep learning. The core idea is to enable a machine to understand human language by converting text into a numerical format, specifically "meaningful vectors".
Here is a detailed summary of the important points:
1. The Problem with Text Data
	• Machine learning models typically work with numerical data (e.g., continuous or categorical features).
	• Human language (text) is unstructured and not directly understandable by these models.
	• The solution is NLP: A domain that provides techniques to process text data and convert it into a numerical representation (vectors) that a model can interpret.
2. The NLP Roadmap (Pyramid Structure from Bottom to Top)
The roadmap is structured in a progressive manner, starting with fundamental concepts and moving towards more advanced techniques. As you move up the pyramid, the models become more accurate but also more complex and computationally intensive.
	• Foundation: Python Programming Language. A strong understanding of Python is essential for implementing NLP tasks and using relevant libraries.
	• Step 1: Text Pre-processing (Part 1)
		○ Goal: Clean the raw text data.
		○ Techniques:
			§ Tokenization: Breaking down text into smaller units (words, sentences, etc.).
			§ Lemmatization: Reducing words to their meaningful base or root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
			§ Stemming: Reducing words to their root form by stripping suffixes (e.g., "programmer" becomes "program").
			§ Stopwords: Removing common words that have little to no semantic value (e.g., "the", "is", "a").
	• Step 2: Text Pre-processing (Part 2 - Converting Text to Vectors)
		○ Goal: Convert the cleaned text into numerical vectors that a machine can understand.
		○ Techniques:
			§ Bag-of-Words (BoW): Represents a document by the count of each word, disregarding grammar and word order.
			§ TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A statistical measure that evaluates how important a word is to a document in a corpus. It gives more weight to rare words and less to common words.
			§ Unigrams and Bigrams: Concepts of sequential words (e.g., "natural language" is a bigram).
	• Step 3: Text Pre-processing (Part 3 - Advanced Vectorization)
		○ Goal: Create more meaningful and contextually aware word vectors.
		○ Techniques:
			§ Word2Vec: A neural network-based technique that learns word associations from a large corpus of text. It creates dense vectors where semantically similar words are located closer to each other in the vector space.
			§ Average Word2Vec: An extension of Word2Vec where the vector for a sentence or document is the average of the vectors of its constituent words.
3. Transition to Deep Learning
	• RNN, LSTM, and GRU: These are types of neural networks specifically designed to handle sequential data, like text. They are used for tasks like spam classification and text summarization.
		○ RNN (Recurrent Neural Network): A basic network for sequential data.
		○ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): More advanced versions of RNNs that address the "vanishing gradient problem" and are better at capturing long-term dependencies in a sequence.
	• Word Embeddings: An amazing way to convert input text into vectors. These techniques are often built on top of Word2Vec, allowing the model to learn its own representations of words.
	• Advanced Techniques (State-of-the-Art):
		○ Transformers and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): These are the most advanced techniques. They are more powerful and achieve higher accuracy, but also have larger model sizes and require more computational resources.
4. Libraries for NLP
	• For Machine Learning:
		○ NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A foundational library for educational and research purposes.
		○ spaCy: A modern, production-ready library known for its speed and efficiency.
	• For Deep Learning:
		○ TensorFlow: An open-source library developed by Google.
		○ PyTorch: An open-source library developed by Facebook.

Core Concepts of Natural Language Processing
This video provides a foundational overview of key terminologies in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The main focus is on tokenization, a fundamental step in text preprocessing, and other related concepts like corpus, documents, and vocabulary. The goal is to lay the groundwork for understanding how computers process human language by breaking it down into manageable units.

1. Fundamental Terminology
	• Corpus: A collection of text, typically in the form of a paragraph. It is the complete body of text you are working with.
	• Documents: Individual sentences within a corpus. A corpus is made up of multiple documents.
	• Vocabulary (or Unique Words): The set of all unique words present in the entire corpus. It is the dictionary of all possible words. The size of the vocabulary is the total count of these unique words.
	• Words: The individual words that make up the corpus.

2. What is Tokenization?
Tokenization is a crucial preprocessing step in NLP. It is the process of breaking down a large piece of text into smaller, meaningful units called tokens. The tokens can be words, sentences, or even characters, depending on the specific task.
	• Paragraph to Sentence Tokenization: This process involves taking a corpus (paragraph) and splitting it into individual sentences (documents). The split is typically done based on punctuation marks like periods (.), question marks (?), or exclamation points (!).
	• Sentence to Word Tokenization: This process takes a sentence and breaks it down into individual words. Each word then becomes a token.
Example:
If the corpus is: "I like to drink apple juice. My friend likes mango juice."
	• Paragraph-to-Sentence Tokenization would produce two tokens:
		1. "I like to drink apple juice."
		2. "My friend likes mango juice."
	• Sentence-to-Word Tokenization on the first sentence would produce the following tokens:
		○ "I"
		○ "like"
		○ "to"
		○ "drink"
		○ "apple"
		○ "juice"

3. Why is Tokenization Important?
	• Foundation for Vectorization: Tokenization is a necessary step because each individual word in the text needs to be converted into a numerical vector for a machine learning model to process it. By breaking down the text into words, we can then apply various techniques to create these vectors.
	• Text Preprocessing: It is a core part of the text preprocessing pipeline. Without this step, it would be impossible to perform subsequent cleaning and feature engineering tasks, such as removing stopwords or performing stemming and lemmatization.
The next video will demonstrate how to perform tokenization in Python using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library.
